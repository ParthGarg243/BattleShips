# Battleships

This project is a Python implementation of the classic board game Battleships, featuring a graphical user interface built with the Tkinter library. In this version of the game, players face an AI opponent, with the AI's ships already strategically placed on the grid. Your mission is to outsmart the AI by guessing the locations of its ships.
